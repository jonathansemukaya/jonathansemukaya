ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning all JavaScript, HTML, CSS and all things related to building an app. I am not yet very experienced with system design and infrastructure as I am self-taught via YouTube, but have worked on a few small projects, and currently I am working on a platform for tech sales individuals who can use AI to tailor their CVs to specific job roles, and manage the job pipeline like a CRM with my brother!
